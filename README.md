# Tunnel
A tool for avoiding internet censorship

# How Does Tunnel Work?

Tunnel launches sites in about:blank so your school or Work cannot see your history of the games you are playing thous making the links not blockeble

# How would I play if the school blocked github and the games are ran from github

All of the sites run through a proxy which lets you roam the internet freely without any restrictions
